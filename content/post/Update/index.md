## May Update

Hii!!
If you noticed, the latest post prior to this is the Cyber Jawara HS 24 Finals, and (un)surprisingly, that is a tad bit more than 4 months!
What happens?? question mark???  

### Life Update

The thing is, I have a scary thing at that time, and people colloquially called it the EA. (What could that possibly mean???)  
EA is the short for External Assessment, more precisely the IB one.  
IB, is short for International Baccalaureate, which is the curriculum that my school teaches...  
Anyway, why is it so terrifying, that I must spend all of my waking hours studying and preparing for it??
Well, that almost-4-weeks (mind you) exam is basically where the majority of my final score for the IB Diploma determined.
You fail and success in IB by that one exam (mostly).  
To keep it short, I've given so much already for this darn curriculum, might as well do the best I can.
I had to do more than a hundred Anki cards everyday for Business Management,
like, it makes me sick sometimes..
Nothing much to say about it, I just study and do the test.
It went, not too bad, honestly,
I'm hoping I get a good score when the result comes out next month.

### Current Projects

Anyway, now that I'm back, I wanna try to keep this blog somewhat alive..
For now, I have A LOT of projects waiting for me T-T  
Let's see if I can list them all:

- My School Red Cross Organization's Website
  - Low motivation, cuz, I'm solo here..
- A website for a Social Project (Economyst.id)
  - Got lots of features, like quizzes, courses, economic tools, account system, man, this would be a hard one.
- Hackclub (yes, I get dragged into it as a co-leader smh)
  - Sprig (a JavaScript game-engine)
    - Making an Endless Turn-based Strategy Game, inspired by HSR & SC2 (what a combo)
    - Been going great honestly, but it's a little slow for progress
    - First JS project btw
  - Boba drop preparation
    - Teaching kids how to make a website, hope my speaking skill won't butcher me here
- CTF (ahh yeaahh)
  - Google CTF incoming, my team is on a big merger!
  - QnQSecCTF too, I gotta update my challenge submission.. I KEEP PROCRASTINATING >_<
  - Compfest 17 is just around the corner.. I'm looking for a team now, sigh..
- This blog, I guess
  - Maybe, I should add comments. How could that be hard?
  - Reverse engineering cheatsheet. I promised for it to some of my friends long time ago..

Okay, actually not that much.
But like, it's not just some side projects..
they're all a full blown one, especially the websites..
hmmm, this all really saying I gotta get back on track now.

### What’s Next

Since I'm going to become a 12th grader, I got things to prepare for college too..
I've made a general college application essay back then, and of course, I could do more!
I took an online class about overseas study and got some great info from it!
In short, I should get IELTS and curate all of my achievements for a better chance at scholarship.
However, the third class is held when I was on a field trip, so I miss it..
It's just that, I'm not the most interested in this right now?
It's not really my top priority, so maybe I'll do it when school break is over.

By the way, I'm on a school break right now as of writing,
and honestly I couldn't say 'no' to my lil cuties whenever they wanna play with me...
So, I've not done much either, family things just get in the way sometimes.
Not saying that it's bad, but like, it's always forced on me, so, awful, you know.
One time they asked me ONLY for a morning jog, then a breakfast at some place,
then get to the groceries, then took me to my cousin's house,
WITHOUT my macbook (how can I play games with them? T-T), staying up late (yes, sleepover),
and then the next day, we went to a funeral while also going back to my home,
but then both families wanna go to the zoo?!?!?
I'M TIRED PLEASE, and I just say no there..
Just a little rant.  
I do wonder who even would read this blog??
Whoever you are, thanks for reading btw :D  
Have a good day..
