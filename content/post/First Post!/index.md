## Recent things first...

Like,
10 minutes agoo,
I RM -RF'ed my local hugo server :<<  
The thing is,
I was deleting WebStorm because I'm not using it anymore for this...  
But UGH I- I forgot- t- the hugo repo is inside a directory named `WebStormProjects`-  
What did I do?

`fd webstorm / -x sudo rm -rf {}`

find,  
anything with webstorm in its name,  
in my ROOT DIRECTORY,  
then execute for each of them:  
`sudo rm -rf {}`

ouch.  
its a bit of a relief that I at least pushed the blank repo 2 git.
But the one big post I was working on for a whole freaking day is gone T-T  
Not just that,
I lost my really cute pdf2md.py converter ;;  
hmph

## Upcoming

Well,
KnighCTF has just ended,
and I solved some of the challenge there.
Not that muchh thought..  
I got a tiresome class schedule today so,
can't really play well enough.
I'll just release the rev write-ups,
maybe tomorrow??  
Tune in :>
