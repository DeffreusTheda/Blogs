## Serikat Newbie Indonesia's Capture the Flag 2024

SNICTF 2024 is such a memorable one for me personally >v<  
It's held by the almighty [SNICTF](https://www.linkedin.com/company/serikatnewbie-id) team, who's known for being on the best in the country!  


In short, I got 4th place and also nominated as for the **best write-up**!
You can see its gdocs version [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rOHj1BjaLcPQfOTUGRcqjM7UX1d8ZWya8h9zZmG6ZuA/edit?usp=sharing).  
Anyway, I'll put the write-up I made here, cuz why not :p

### [100] quotes of the day [31 Solves]

Kata-katanya dong buat hari ini.

#### Solving it

Got `quotes_of_the_day.png: PNG image data, 808530225 x 808529968, 32-bit`, then I tried strings on it:  

![](image2.png)
  
That strings looks reverse, so I tried ran `cat 'quotes_of_the_day.png' | rev >quotes_of_the_day_reversed.png` but it failed. So I just `strings quotes_of_the_day.png | rev >strings-rev` it and `cat strings-rev`:


![](image3.png)
  
Damn, that’s big but it’s just binary of ASCII, and using [gchq.github.io/cyberchef](http://gchq.github.io/cyberchef), I’m able to get this part of the flag:  

![](image4.png)
  
Okay, so I open up `strings-rev` in Helix and found this:

That’s three parts of the flag found!

Here’s a refactor of main (Thanks LLM). I hope that even if you’re a beginner, you can infer the meaning from the function name, just practice research and searching teehee:

{{< highlight c >}}
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

int main(void) {
   FILE* flag_file;
   char* flag_content;
   size_t file_size;
   const char* key = "SerikatNewbieIndonesia";
   const int key_length = 22;
  
   flag_file = fopen("flag.txt", "r");
  
   // Get file size
   fseek(flag_file, 0, SEEK_END);
   file_size = ftell(flag_file);
   fseek(flag_file, 0, SEEK_SET);
  
   flag_content = (char*)malloc(file_size + 1);
  
   fread(flag_content, 1, file_size, flag_file); // store to memory
   flag_content[file_size - 1] = '\0'; // null terminator
  
   int content_length = strlen(flag_content);
   
   // reversing section
  
   int left = 1;
   int right;
   if (content_length % 2 == 0) {
       right = content_length - 1;
   } else {
       right = content_length - 2;
   }
  
   while (left < right) {
       char temp = flag_content[left];
       flag_content[left] = flag_content[right];
       flag_content[right] = temp;
      
       left += 2;
       right -= 2;
   }
  
   for (int i = 0; i < content_length; i++) {

       // Print encoded value
       printf("%d", encoded);
   }
  
   // Print newline and cleanup
   putchar('\n');
   fclose(flag_file);
   free(flag_content);

So, I’ve renamed the variable for easier reading. Thank me, okay. You can see that this program just opens up `flag.txt`, and uses an iterator to work with it. Up until line 565, it’s just a setup not worth going into details. Line 565 - 569 make sure `n_` is even, as we swap odd indexed ([1], [3], etc.) characters with its symmetrical counterpart, leaving the first character (and the last if length is odd) untouched. Here’s a visualization:  

![](image7.png)
  
A quite interesting byte swap method, I guess. Then, it just XOR the bytes with a key that we know, so it’s pretty much useless. We can even just use the encryption method to decrypt it, duh. We reverse the output from `output.txt` that was given to us on the XOR first, then the swap- like that, and we’ll have the flag!

#### Reversing

So, it uses 3 different checkers functions for the input. The only difference is the operation done on the byte, and they return true if the index of the byte is in the array row accessed with the result of the operation. Rows of the ‘mapping’ or ‘table’ is accessed through a byte’s:

- Checker1: higher 4 bits (OOOO.XXXX)  
- Checker2: second until fourth least significant bit. (XXXX.OOOX)  
- Checker3: least significant bit (XXXX.XXXO)

So, I just brute forced it. There’s only 100 printable characters, and if you see, the highest index value is 41, so the input length should be 42\. That’s computable!

### [500] Huh [1 Solve]


![](image9.png)
  
###### Author: msfir

#### tl;dr

“Single-responsibility principle”. That’s what the author said to me before I even started working on it. This chall just annoys reversers with multiple functions that do the same thing. It uses a substitution table and, honestly-I-don’t-know-cipher cuz I just brute it. That’s it!

#### Entry

As always, roll out the reversing carpet. Ghidra then detects an `entry` function, and we’ll jump there!  

![](image10.png)
  
So, it calls a function that detects and gathers information about the CPU, nothing interesting there, except the function pointer that I’ve given the name `~main_yuk`. `_just_cpu_detecting` then call a function that passes `~main_yuk` to call it.

#### Main


![](image11.png)
  
Figure A: Renamed; There’s more and more below :p

You peek at it and… a scroll of function calls. Like, just a mile row of them lining up. Such a sight to see. You see more or less it’s divided into 3 by the parameter similarities. Let’s call these `clusters`. Why? Do they have similar functionality? (yes they are). 

#### Print Functions

So, I look at one of them,   

![](image12.png)
  
And all it does is just call `~bawang` (I renamed it), except with a constant as its first argument. I step out, then check all of the functions within the first cluster and all they do is call `~bawang`, but with a different `param_1`. So then I follow along where this `param_1` is passed along numerous calls and end up with  

![](image13.png)
  
It calls a function by a pointer, and yeah I don’t know what it does. But what I do know is that when the program first runs it’ll output “Give me flag:”. And well you know, that `param_1` really looks like an ASCII character and correct, and sure they are. So as you can see I’ve already renamed these functions based on what ASCII character they’re passing to `~bawang`, and you can kinda make sense of the output (a prompt) in Figure A. In conclusion, `~bawang` just prints a character LOL.

#### Input Length

What follows is these 32 functions with prefix ‘/’ that shares the same functionality,  

![](image14.png)
  
Yeah, let me tell you that `read_stream_byte` (renamed) just basically reads ONE byte from a stream, presumably stdin, so we don’t need to go into details about it. It prints “Wrong” if the character read was a newline character, which means that for all 32 bytes read from the stream, it should not be a newline character. In other words, our input length should be **32**!

#### Writing Input to Memory

For this particular `/0`, it writes that byte to `DAT_004a3b2c`. I jump into that memory address referenced and identified what is probably an array of bytes,  

![](image15.png)
  
And ends at `DAT_004a3b2f`. See, 0x2f - 0x10 is equal to 31, so this REAALLY seems like where these `/` prefix functions. Except that `/0` write to NOT the first index in this array. If I order from `/0` to `/31` where it write their address, it’ll be

{{< highlight text >}}
DAT_004a3b2c
DAT_004a3b19
DAT_004a3b29
DAT_004a3b14

What do we get from this? So, in short, the program writes input bytes in a ‘random’ order. Basically, like a substitution table, or a map, uh honestly I don’t know what to call it. We can `reverse` this with a `reverse` map, that we can generate with

{{< highlight py >}}
 with open('orderofwrite', 'r') as f:
     idx = 0
     for line in f:
         wto = int(line[10:-1], 16)-0x10
         print(f'map[{wto:#02d}] = {idx}')
         idx += 1
{{< /highlight >}}


Which will output

{{< highlight py >}}
map[28] = 0
map[09] = 1
map[25] = 2
map[04] = 3
map[24] = 4
map[20] = 5
map[17] = 6
map[29] = 7
map[31] = 8
map[12] = 9
map[14] = 10
map[11] = 11
map[05] = 12
map[23] = 13
map[22] = 14
map[13] = 15
map[01] = 16
map[19] = 17

map[03] = 19
map[00] = 20
map[18] = 21
map[06] = 22
map[30] = 23
map[07] = 24
map[10] = 25
map[26] = 26
map[15] = 27
map[27] = 28
map[21] = 29
map[08] = 30
map[16] = 31
{{< /highlight >}}


That we can use as an assignment for the reverse map!

#### THE Checker


![](image16.png)
  
I denote functions with a prefix `‘` as a byte checker that checks whether the character at that index matches a target byte. If not, it prints “Wrong” and quits the program. This means ALL 32 checks must pass until we get to where it prints “Correct”.  

![](image17.png)
  
The other checker functions look pretty much the same except that they have different constants for the ‘key’ (`uVar2)` and target value (operand in `if`). It calls `_pusing` (I should’ve picked a better name) with these two values which itself looks like  

![](image18.png)
  
It xor the input byte with the key multiple times and multiplying key by 2, until key becomes 0, then return the resulting input byte. That’s possible because the key is a byte, and I don’t need to explain to you about overflow. What’s important is: how to reverse this? Duh, since there’s only 100 (printable) possible input values, we can just brute force this method until we get the target value. EZ! 

#### Multiple Checkers??

When I made the solver, I noticed that it failed, even if it should be successful. What’s wrong? Turns out, there are THREE different types of checkers, and function `‘0` uses what’s codenamed `_pusing`. The other, I codenamed `_grrr` and `_charcoal` (I just rename them with what’s there on my immediate thought okay).

Lemme tell you this: the same solution for `_pusing` (i.e. bruteforce) also applies to these two, AND they have similar parameter definition, so you only really need to change what you call. The checker function called for character N are

I referenced how function pointers are implemented and used in another pwn challenge (Coloring). And well, even after characters are checked with the correct function, I still can’t get the flag. Why? dummy, it’s just a mistype for one of the variables in `_charcoal`, changed it from char to unsigned int (or the other way around, I don’t remember), and now the solver is working!!

### [500] OhNoo [2 Solve]

oh noo, i cant see it even using disassambler  
###### Author: FlaBBB

#### tl;dr

Can’t disassemble, `mprotect` with rwx for runtime-code-injection (crazy ikr), byte xor + multiplication encryption, and then byte xor with byte before it except that it changes midhalf. Very stressful, very fun, very brutal, very cute. Can’t recommend. The other solver isn’t valid if you know, cuz I’M THE ONLY TRUE-

#### Can’t disassemble?

So, cool, okay, you can’t disassemble it. What then?  

![](image21.png)
  
Weird label, isn’t it? As if that part of the operand should be an instruction…, cuz well it actually is supposed to be an instruction. Just tell our lovely Ghidra to treat that instruction with a shorter length, right click \>\> Modify Instruction Length…  

![](image22.png)
  

![](image23.png)
  
Now it can be disassembled!! Yayy :DD- but wait there’s more! There’s another one of this trick at 0x0010110f, just do the same thing and voila! Press D to disassemble these newly accessible bytes!! 0x0010110f should looks like   

![](image24.png)
   
Wowww, a lot of jumps, but now that everything's disassemble-able, let’s focus on the `~main` function!  

![](image25.png)
  
Eeh, just your standard input procedure, then- writing bytes to instructions region in memory? Woah. Ghidra is scared omg calm down, I know it’s read only but I’ll explain it when you’re properly fed with the right food (i.e. binary, like literally the illustration shows him eating 0 and 1 😭 that’s rad).

#### Patch Ghidra’s Food (I was hungry when I wrote this ok)

Okay, cool, runtime-instruction-injection, or whatever you call it, but what if I tell you, we don’t even need to run this program? Lemme explain: WE HAVE THE INSTRUCTION RIGHT THERE. JUST, JUST HEX EDIT IT TO THE BINARY AS IF WE’RE ON RUNTIME AND PATCH IT! \-and then we feed Ghidra the new binary\~ :3  

![](image26.png)
  
That’s how it looks before you patch it! I use Helix (best editor ever; it was a breeze) to format the instruction from these rows of assignments into hexes. After that just open up HexEd.it and paste that to the correct address at 0x00101d20. Patched! Now `~encrypt` looks like   

![](image27.png)


#### mprotect RWX

Still have those ugly looking runtime instruction assignments, but now we’re on to the real deal. `~encrypt` is the pointer to the runtime injected instructions. It calls `~rwx` (renamed) which basically just sets read + write + execute permission for the memory page pointed by `~encrypt`. Here, look:  

![](image28.png)
  
It use `sysconf(0x1e)` to get the page size (iirc), then calls `mprotect` with flags as 7 (READ | WRITE | EXECUTE; you should already know this amirite).

#### Encryption


![](image29.png)


Yeah, see there, it calls `~encrypt` and passes `~key` to it, 0x341240e33a1242230a1002d3, exactly 12 bytes (0xc). If you’re smart, you’ll immediately see the fourth argument is the key len! The same for input too! How the ‘result’ is output there with these `if` is redundant, so let’s just focus on `~encrypt`.

##### First Phase


![](image30.png)
  
Shorter than I expected… there’s two `do` loops there, so 2 phases of encryption. The first phase does xor input bytes with key bytes on corresponding index, combined with a multiplication with 0x79. Okay, okay, how to reverse this? Because we’re working in bytes, we can find the multiplicative inverse of 0x79 with

{{< highlight c >}}
    for (uint16_t i = 0*; i < 256; i++) {*
        if ((i * mult) % 256 == 1) {
            mult_inverse = i*;*
            break;
        }
    }
{{< /highlight >}}


If we multiply a byte multiplied by 0x79 with the multiplicative inverse of 0x79, we’ll get the byte back! XOR is XOR, and you can just XOR XOR-ed byte with the same XOR key to get back the un-XOR-ed byte XD.

##### Second Phase

Aight, for the second phase, it XOR the second-half of input with input byte at index `length/2` (middle but choose right if even length), and the the first half with the last already-XOR-ed byte. However, look at the code and tell me what’s off here.

C'mon look at it pls, find it, wait not find it, like, `edge case`, wait not edge case, uh just give great notice to index and how `tmp` change before XOR-ing the byte. (not the syntax error, something to do with index)  
Found it? Aww, you know what, I’ll tell you: the middlemost byte XOR itself. Sad, I know, I’m sorry to hear it. AND WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU XOR YOURSELF? \-you become nothing, you die- I- I- I mean zero. Oh, any byte could XOR itself and become zero. So, how do we know what a byte is before it XOR itself??  
Yeah- it’s brute force (again)

Okay so sorry for the long pages, I’m really an unprofessional WU writer but I hope you get the `intended reading experience` XD.  
Anyway, how to reverse the second phase? Dunno, I just do it like

{{< highlight c >}}
    size_t half_len = input_len >> 1;
    uint8_t xor_byte = p_input[input_len - 1];
    
    // second encryption loop
    size_t idx = 0;
    while (idx != input_len) {
        if (idx == half_len) {
            xor_byte = p_input[input_len - half_len];
        }
        p_input[idx] ^= xor_byte;
        if (idx == half_len) {
            p_input[half_len] = mid; // Guess
            xor_byte = p_input[input_len - half_len]; // Don't ask 
        }
        idx++;
    }
{{< /highlight >}}


*mid* is the guessed byte before the middlemost byte XOR itself. Yeah, brute force :3.

#### Output

We get `out.txt` and it contains

I just go to Python builtins documentation and searching for functions that return an int or float:

- `hash()`: but it changes with every session so no.  
- `find(c, s=0)`: get the index of character `c`, in substring [`s`:]. This is what I used to solve this challenge.  
- `ord(flag[idx])`: this is much better but I figured this out after I solved it 💀  
  Okay, `find`, if there’s not a single char `c` in substring [`s`:], it’ll return -1, indicating us to stop. So do that for every printable character!

This is just an intro/warmup chall, I felt like. I can just brute force the multiplication of `n` as `m`, and see if that `m` is comprehensible or not.

My fiancé keeps her secret archive on a blockhain contract, but she forgot the key. Of course I as his future husband will help him.

Our goal is to submitSecret() with the correct secret value, as there, it’s redacted. As we get the needed functions, like getSecret and submitSecret, we only need to use them!

## I’LL MISS YOU, GRANDMA 💜


![](image56.png)
  
Friday, 09.17, I got a message from my dad.  
I never expected that day, I’ll lose someone I’ve known since I was little.  
I usually repress the bad things I felt, but I can’t this time.  
I just want to let you know, it’s been a hard time that weekends,  
but SNI CTF helped distract me when I’m drowning.  
This write-up is one medium for which I express my immediate feelings.

May all the virtues in the world and everafter overflow you, grandma.  
Please remember, that I always cherish you, with all my heart, & I always will.  
I’ll miss you forever, grandma…

Thanks for reading, stay safe. Never die.
